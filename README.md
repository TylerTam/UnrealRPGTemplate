# UnrealTPS-Prototype
Hi! This is a small third person shooter project I've been working on. Originally, the plan was to make an RPG template / educational project for others to use as a base, but I've just continued on making this project while looking for my next professional role, and eventually it morphed into a third person shooter project that I am still working on.

I've still decided to keep the project open source, so others might learn or make use from this project. If you do decide to use this project as a template, feel free to. I'd appreciate if you'd let me know, since Im just a curious person by nature, but this isn't a requirement, obviously.

If, in the future, I decide make more out of this project, I'll keep this repo open, but will branch of into a private repo for that project.
